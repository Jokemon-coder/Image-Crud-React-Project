# Demo for my second ReactJS project

## Introduction

This is a demo for my project that I am working on, more details can be found in the main branch and it's README. This is not representative of the final and finished project, but I am showcasing it here because it still has things worth showing, like ReactJS and JavaScript code along with CSS styling. 

You can visit it here and the predetermined username and password are "User" and "1234".
